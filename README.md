# Modelling-Human-Behaviour-in-Chess
This project was developed through 4 milestones:
- **Milestone 1:** Project Proposal (Refer *Project_Proposal.pdf*)
- **Milestone 2:** Finding Relevant Papers for the project (Refer *Project_Reading_List.pdf*)
- **Milestone 3:** Summarising the papers listed in Milestone 2 (Refer *Literature_Survey.pdf*)
- **Milestone 4:** Final Project Report (Refer *Final_Report.pdf*)

#### Project Brief:
We introduce the core idea of developing predictive models by leveraging existing agents or bots. We demonstrate this idea by creating a model that predicts human play with help from the Stockfish chess engine. In particular, our results show that transformer architectures, and their ability to handle variable-length inputs, are well-suited to this problem.

Please refer project report for further details on experiments and results.
